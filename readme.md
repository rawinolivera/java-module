# Overview

Expense Tracker, in this module I develop a app that allows the user register their expenses classifying them by category. I use a ControlExpense class to manage the list where Category and Registration will be stored. I also have different methods that allow me to import (create) and export a CSV file that I'm using like a kind of database so that when the user close the program and come back the data is there present. To give some insights to the program I created two method that will allow the user to see the list of expenses by categories and its total and another that allows the user to see the stats of the expenses showing a type of balance with the total per category and the percentage that represents.
